# Data Catalogue Prototypes

This prototype is based on the [GOV.UK prototype kit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit)

The aim of the GDX Data Catalogue is to: 

* Help users find data services and datasets
* Help them understand if a data service or dataset is right for their needs

These prototypes experiment with different ways of supporting that.
